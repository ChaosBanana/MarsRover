# Mars Rover

To run tests:
~~~
npm install
npm run test
~~~

This technical challenge took about 1,5h.

The required input/output integration test is present. Also, Rover class has unit tests because it clearly needs them.

Type checking is not present because it requires a specialized solution but often it's a good idea.
